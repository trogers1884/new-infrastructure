- Consistent pattern following roles implementation

### 2. Groups Management
- CRUD operations with group type relationships
- Active status handling
- Code validation with type-specific uniqueness

### 3. Stores Management

## Critical Next Steps

### 1. Authentication/Authorization Implementation
- Need to implement middleware for web routes
- Setup API authentication
- Define permission checking mechanisms
- Create helpers/facades for permission verification

### 2. Usage Documentation Needed For:
- Web route protection
- API endpoint security
- Permission checking in views
- Role-based access control in controllers
- Group/Store context handling

### 3. Testing Requirements
- Authentication flows
- Authorization rules
- Context-based permissions
- API security

This infrastructure now has a solid foundation for authentication and authorization, but needs documentation and implementation guidelines for actual use in the application.
