# Component-Based Laravel Infrastructure Project Summary

## Project Context
- Consolidating multiple Laravel applications into a single application
- Supporting multiple auto groups under Murgado Automotive Group
- Need to support various domains: loyalty, management reporting, cafe menu products, trading desk

## Key Decisions Made

### Component Structure
```
app/
├── Components/
│   ├── Api/
│   │   ├── Contracts/
│   │   ├── Services/
│   │   │   ├── Loyalty/
│   │   │   ├── Management/
│   │   │   ├── Cafe/
│   │   │   └── Trading/
│   │   └── Providers/
│   └── Auth/
```

### Database Organization
- Using PostgreSQL with multiple schemas
- Tables prefixed with 'tbl_'
- Reading through views
- Schemas:
  - public: Laravel/vendor tables
  - auth: Authentication/authorization
  - org: Organization structure
  - [Additional schemas pending for other domains]

### Authentication/Authorization
- Users table remains in public schema
- Role/permission system in auth schema
- Complex store/group relationship management
- Support for multiple group types (auto group, campus, brand)

### Implementation Standards
- Write to tables, read from views
- Use both sequential and natural keys
- Schema-specific migrations
- Custom migration base structure with timing and logging

## Next Steps To Discuss
1. Core schema implementation
2. API standardization
3. Component interaction patterns
4. Additional domain implementations
5. Data validation strategies

## Technical Requirements
- Laravel 10
- PostgreSQL 16
- Alma Linux environment
- PHP 8.1

## Current Progress
- Basic component structure established
- Authentication framework set up
- Organization structure defined
- Initial database schemas and migrations created
